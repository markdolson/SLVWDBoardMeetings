# Old Business:
## Long Service Line Agreement for Jameson Property
Darren Langfield (Engineering Manager) explained that the Jamesons are requesting water service where none currently exists (their property is north of Boulder Creek on Shadow Mountain Road).  It is standard practice in such situations for the customer to assume responsibility for constructing the underground line from the existing meter.  The contract itself was inadvertently omitted from the Board packet, but there was unanimous agreement that it is in the District’s best interest to acquire this new customer.  Board members asked about some of the implementation details, but the only significant question (raised by Director Fultz) was whether the contract could be rewritten to better reflect the best interests of the customer.  It was agreed that this question can be deferred to a future occasion.  The Board voted 5-0 to approve the proposed agreement.

## Final Draft Fiscal Year 2020/21 Budget Review
Stephanie Hill (Finance Manager) provided a brief overview of the proposed budget (essentially the same as the budget discussed at the past two Board meetings).  The total is $21.8M, with $11.8M for capital projects (a significant increase over prior years).  Operating expenses increase $447K (to $8.4M) mainly due to routine employee-related expenses ($320K) and to intermittent expenses such as election fees and the Urban Water Management Plan ($90K).  Operating revenues (89% of the District’s revenue) increase (to $11.4M) as expected with the approved rate increase.  Reserves are expected to increase by $61K.

Salaries and benefits account for two thirds of the operating expenses (there are 35 full-time-equivalent employees, 62% of which work primarily out in the field).  Staffing levels have been flat across recent years, but associated expenses have increased by 7% over the previous year.

The District is tackling multiple major capital projects this year.  These include the Redwood Park Tank, the Lompico Tanks, and five main pipelines (all funded by the $14.5M Certificate of Participation financing).  There is also one main FEMA project (the Lion slide repair) related to the FY16-17 storm damage (for which at least 75% of the cost should be covered by FEMA). Two projects received grant funding: CEQA work for the Intertie and the System Wide Master Plan.

Director Moran asked a number of detailed questions, most of which seemed oriented toward better understanding other minor sources of revenue.  Stephanie said that it is still too soon to make any empirically-based projections relating to the impact of Covid-19, but it is reasonable to anticipate some increase in home water use due to increased occupancy and gardening.  Director Moran asked who is available for grant writing.  The primary person is the Environmental Planner; a 2020 RFQ for additional assistance did not receive any response.  Director Moran also recommended that Board stipends be revisited at a future meeting.

Director Fultz read a long and impassioned statement about the importance of revising the District’s budgeting process to responsibly ground it in a longer-term focus.  The gist of his argument was that expenses cannot be allowed to continue increasing.  He said, “If we accept this budget, we are moving into the same realm as the previous Board, allowing 100% of the rate increase to be consumed by increased expenses …  The first rule when you are in a hole is that you must stop digging ...  What concrete benefits are we getting for this increased spending?  … What regularly measured metrics demonstrate these benefits in a manner that can be understood?  … The Board actions that Director Henry cited in the last meeting are all in the past … We have 8,000 bosses who are asking what we are doing for them today ...  We can't continue to conduct business as usual ...  We're not wealthy like Scotts Valley and Santa Cruz. “

Director Henry responded by saying that the District is shouldering new responsibility and fixing the infrastructure in a big way while the whole U.S. is behind on infrastructure.  She argued that the Board needs to provide the staff with the money to get this work done, and that it’s not like we’re throwing money down the toilet.

Director Farris said Director Fultz made some very good points that can’t be ignored and that, in the next Fiscal Year, the Board needs to discuss how to increase the District’s revenue stream.  He said he is not advocating for cutting expenses, just for slowing the growth in expenses.

President Swan agreed that Director Fultz made a number of good points.  He also agreed with Director Farris that the next twelve months should be spent focusing on the budget and that the key to success lies in finding new revenue opportunities.
The budget was approved 4-1 with Director Fultz in opposition.

*Commentary:  The hard reality is that the District continues to have more potential budget items in need of funding than it has the revenue to fund.  Some of these items are long-delayed infrastructure investments and others are simply escalating costs of doing business.  Any organization caught in this kind of bind is inevitably going to struggle.  In general, though, there are at least three strategies that can serve such organizations well, and there is at least one other strategy that is typically less helpful.*

*The three constructive strategies are: (a) develop a culture of operational excellence by getting better each year at spending money as wisely as possible, (b) develop a culture that is supportive of innovation by promoting a judicious amount of “outside-the-box” thinking and by monitoring the experiences of similar organizations elsewhere, and (c) invest in staff training to develop internal capabilities that reduce the need for expensive outside consultants.  The key point about these strategies is they are incremental in nature – it takes both time and persistence for them to bear fruit.*

*All five Directors clearly see at least some value in these strategies, but only Director Henry seems to be strongly making the case that these strategies are precisely the tools that the Board needs to rely upon (though Director Henry’s focus seems to be largely on the first of these strategies).*

*In contrast, the above-mentioned less-helpful strategy relies more heavily on what is essentially magical thinking.  In Director Fultz’s version, there is a potentially cataclysmic event (i.e., some form of financial insolvency) lurking just beyond the horizon, and only drastic action today will save the District from this fate.  Unfortunately, the positive consequences of the proposed action (i.e., budget cutting) are purely speculative.  Director Fultz is surely correct to advocate for budgetary planning to be as comprehensive as feasible, but it doesn’t follow that he should hold the current budget hostage to this goal (nor that he should routinely equate spending with waste and/or equate a prohibition on spending with transformative innovation).*

*For Directors Farris and Swan, the dream is that the District can wriggle its way out of its current financial bind via new sources of revenue.  They are surely correct to encourage innovative exploration of this possibility, but they have now been promoting this solution for many months with no sign of significant progress.  Meanwhile, the most obvious potential source of new revenue (namely, new grants) has received relatively little attention.*

*Lastly, there is one other point that bears mention here.  The above paragraphs all concern the way forward, and this is indeed what matters most.  However, some of the Board’s thinking about the future remains entangled in conflicting narratives about how the District ended up in its current predicament.*

*The storyline that dominated the 2018 electoral campaign was that the previous Board spent money foolishly and that it would be easy to rectify this by voting out the incumbents.  The previous Board certainly authorized specific expenditures that were easy targets for public criticism, and it further invited public disapproval by pushing (successfully) for higher water rates.*

*A possibility that the current Board entirely ignores, though, is that water rates (across the state) were historically set too low to allow for adequate infrastructure upkeep.  The rate increase enacted by the previous Board was to enable the District to obtain the loans needed to address deferred infrastructure maintenance, and the increased revenues in the FY2020-21 budget are in fact covering the associated loan costs, as intended.  From this perspective, higher water rates are simply a long-overdue acknowledgment of a painful reality.*

*Directors who believe that huge amounts of previous revenue were frittered away and/or that sizable amounts of current revenue are being misdirected have a responsibility to provide specific evidence for these beliefs.  Director Fultz has repeatedly evaded this responsibility by insisting that: (a) somebody else should explain all the previous spending to him, and (b) somebody else should figure out how the District can deliver essential services while spending even less money going forward.*

## Award of Construction Contract for 2020 Pipeline Replacement Project
Darren explained that this project involves the replacement of about 3300 feet of water main on Hillside Drive and California Ave in Ben Lomond.  Five bids were received, and the low bidder (at $1.2M, about $300K below the highest bid) was Anderson Pacific.  The District is currently using Anderson Pacific for the construction of the Lompico Tanks Replacement Project, and work on that project is proceeding smoothly.  The Board was highly appreciative of Darren’s work on this project (moving forward rapidly, obtaining multiple bids, and enabling work to be performed during the summer of 2020) and asked only about a few details.  Director Fultz wanted to know if Anderson Pacific (based in Santa Clara) would be employing anyone local, but this information was not available.  The Board voted 5-0 to approve the proposed agreement.

## Award of Construction Management Contract for 2020 Pipeline Replacement Project
Darren explained that this contract is for technical management and bookkeeping on the California Avenue project discussed immediately above.  MME Civil & Structural Engineering submitted the low bid (of two) for about $78,000.  MME successfully performed construction management on the Probation Tank Project which was completed earlier this year, and MME is also currently providing effective construction management of the Lompico Tanks Replacement Project.  Again, the Board asked only about a few details, and Director Fultz requested that the Board receive a quarterly progress report to facilitate tracking of expenses.  The Board voted 5-0 to approve the proposed agreement.

# New Business:
## Ordering an Election
Two Board seats (Directors Farris and Moran) are up for election on November 3, 2020.   Prior to the election, state law requires special districts to file a Notice of Election with the County Clerk verifying which offices are up for election, as well as other pertinent information.  The estimated cost is between $1.50 and $2.50 per voter ($26,000 to $43,000 total).  The Board was satisfied with the default scenario in which candidate statements are limited to 200 words, and candidates are not reimbursed by the District for their publishing costs (a few hundred dollars).  The Board voted 4-0 to approve this expenditure; Director Farris abstained.

## Esri Contract
In 2017, the District chose Esri ArcGIS software for the implementation of the District’s new GIS system. The original three-year contract was for $30,000.  ArcGIS software provides the ability to perform spatial analysis, hydrologic modeling, and mapping. Staff uses ArcGIS on numerous projects ranging from Fire Management to Watershed Protection.  Staff has been pleased with the ArcGIS software and tech support provided by Esri.  Based on the limited options for this type of software and staff’s familiarity with the ArcGIS software, staff recommended awarding another three-year software contract to Esri.  This item elicited only minimal discussion.  The Board voted 5-0 to approve the new contract.

# District Reports:
## Department Status
The Directors sought minor updates from Legal and Operations.  For Environmental, Director Fultz asked whether the District intends to publish updated water conservation goals; he noted that specific goals help people to understand what they should be doing.  Carly Blanchard (Environmental Planner) said that the District is unlikely to target a lower goal, as we are currently around 25% below the state average.  Director Farris asked whether it would be helpful to formally prioritize Carly’s current list of activities.  Carly replied that some prioritization has been provided via the Environment Committee.
